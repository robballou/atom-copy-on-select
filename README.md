# atom-copy-on-select package

Copies the selection to the clipboard automatically.

## Installation

Currently this is very alpha/WIP so it's not in APM yet, so:

    pushd ~/.atom/packages
    git clone git@github.com:robballou/atom-copy-on-select.git
    popd
    
You likely need to restart atom or reload views.
